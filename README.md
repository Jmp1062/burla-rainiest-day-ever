# Global Rainiest Day Ever — a Burla demo

Scan **every single-day rainfall measurement in NOAA GHCN-Daily** (the public
worldwide station archive, one `YYYY.csv.gz` per year, ~276 files) and find
the largest daily precipitation ever recorded, plus a top-500 leaderboard
and a top-by-distinct-station leaderboard.

## Headline result

> **1,750.0 mm (68.9 in) at Koumac, New Caledonia — January 17, 1976.**
> Largest single-day PRCP in NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily.

Stats from the actual run (on Burla's `plus-dig` cluster, 2026-04-18):

- **3,177,336,585 rows scanned** across 265 year-files (1763 → 2026).
- **1,090,829,523 valid PRCP observations** (post-filter, mm).
- **Map phase wall-clock: ~90 s**; reduce: ~30 s. Total ≈ **2 minutes**.
- 12 early-modern years (1751–1762) don't exist in the NOAA `by_year/` index —
  only the 1750 file and 1763+ are published. Everything else processed cleanly.

See `burla_results/` for the artifacts produced by the remote run.

Tropical cyclones (Koumac, Queensland), windward-slope orographic storms
(Haleakala on Maui!), the Indian summer monsoon (Cherrapunji / Mawsynram),
typhoons near Japan, Aleutian storms — the leaderboard reads like a tour
of every major wet-weather regime on Earth.

## How it works

- One remote CPU per calendar year (`remote_parallel_map`).
- Each worker streams a `YYYY.csv.gz`, filters `PRCP` rows, emits the year's
  top 100 to `/workspace/shared/ghcn/parts/YYYY.json`.
- One reduce worker merges all parts into a global top-500, joins station
  metadata (name / lat-lon / country), and writes:
  - `top_result.json` — the single headline record (with citation + note)
  - `top_500.csv` — raw leaderboard (500 rows — many from the same station)
  - `top_by_station.csv` — each distinct station's best day (deduplicated)
  - `map.html` — single-file Leaflet map of the top-25 pins
  - `run_summary.json` — rows scanned, failures, timings

## Data source

- **Year shards:** `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/YYYY.csv.gz`
- **Station metadata:** `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt`
- **Country codes:** `https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-countries.txt`
- **Row schema** per NOAA `readme-by_year.txt`:
  `ID, YYYYMMDD, ELEMENT, DATA VALUE, M-FLAG, Q-FLAG, S-FLAG, OBS-TIME`
- **Units:** PRCP is stored in **tenths of mm**; we divide by 10.

### Bundled station snapshot (`data/`)

Station names, lat/lon, elevation, and country come from NOAA's
`ghcnd-stations.txt` (129,657 rows, ~11 MB) and `ghcnd-countries.txt`
(219 rows). Both are committed into `data/` as a **point-in-time snapshot**
so the demo is reproducible even if NOAA is down or rate-limiting:

```
data/
├── ghcnd-stations.txt    # 11 MB, 129,657 rows (id -> name, lat, lon, elev, state)
└── ghcnd-countries.txt   # 4 KB, 219 rows     (country_code -> country name)
```

Both `stations.py` (local path) and `_load_stations_inline()` (Burla reduce
worker) look up the bundle first and fall back to NOAA if it's missing.
When `main()` runs on Burla it also stages the bundle once into
`/workspace/shared/ghcn/meta/` so every subsequent reduce run hits GCS
instead of NOAA.

**Refreshing the snapshot** — whenever NOAA publishes a newer station file:

```bash
python refresh_station_snapshot.py
git add data/ && git commit -m "refresh station snapshot"
```

## Filters

- `ELEMENT == "PRCP"` (single-day totals only; multi-day `MDPR` totals excluded).
- Rows with non-empty `Q-FLAG` (NOAA's own QC rejected them) dropped.
- `-9999` and empty values dropped.
- No extra capping — the leaderboard stands on its own. If a value looks
  extreme, the raw row is there in `top_500.csv` with its M/S/Q-flags and
  station ID so anyone can verify.

## How to run

### Prereqs

Uses the canonical starter-kit flow from `agents/burla/burla.md` and the
per-account venv under `~/.burla/joeyper23/.venv/` (Python 3.12,
`burla==1.4.5`).

### 1. Local smoke test (no Burla)

```bash
cd agents/ghcn-rainiest-day
SHARED_DIR=./local_shared \
  /Users/josephperry/.burla/joeyper23/.venv/bin/python local_validate.py 1995 2000
```

Expected: `LOCAL_OK` and a `HEADLINE:` line printed. Artifacts end up under
`./local_shared/ghcn/results/`.

### 2. Full run on Burla (1750 → current year)

```bash
# (a) Ensure cluster is ready (idempotent)
python ../burla-agent-starter-kit/onboard.py --email joeyper23@gmail.com

# (b) Submit the pipeline (map phase ~90 s, reduce ~30 s)
python ../burla-agent-starter-kit/run_job.py \
  --email joeyper23@gmail.com \
  ghcn_pipeline.py

# (c) Pull artifacts back to ./burla_results/
python ../burla-agent-starter-kit/run_job.py \
  --email joeyper23@gmail.com \
  fetch_artifacts.py
```

#### Reduce-only re-runs (skip 90 s map phase)

```bash
REDUCE_ONLY=1 python ../burla-agent-starter-kit/run_job.py \
  --email joeyper23@gmail.com \
  ghcn_pipeline.py
```

Reuses the per-year JSONs already in `/workspace/shared/ghcn/parts/`.

#### Narrow the range

```bash
GHCN_START_YEAR=1950 GHCN_END_YEAR=2025 \
  python ../burla-agent-starter-kit/run_job.py \
  --email joeyper23@gmail.com ghcn_pipeline.py
```

## Honest framing (use this in any public post)

- **The claim:** largest single-day PRCP in NOAA GHCN-Daily (global station
  network, quality-filtered).
- **NOT the claim:** "the wettest day that ever happened on Earth." GHCN is
  a station network with uneven coverage (dense in the US, Europe, parts of
  Asia; sparse in oceans and some tropical regions). Satellite-era TRMM/GPM
  gridded products will disagree with station values at specific locations.
- **Data quality caveat:** station NC000091577 (Koumac) accounts for 151 of
  the top 500 rows in `top_500.csv`, including the top 7 entries all in the
  1,505–1,750 mm range. These are during the Southern-Hemisphere cyclone
  season (January), which is physically consistent with intense tropical
  cyclones, but their clustering at one station is unusual. NOAA's Q-flag
  did not reject them. Publishing them as-is and providing
  `top_by_station.csv` lets readers see both the raw result and the
  geographically-diverse view side by side.

## Client-version note

The `joeyper23` account's `~/.burla/joeyper23/user_config.json` pins
`burla==1.4.5`, whose `remote_parallel_map` signature is
`(function_, inputs, func_cpu=1, func_ram=4, detach=False, generator=False, spinner=True, max_parallelism=None)`.
There is **no `grow=True`** in this client version — the cluster must be ON
before the call. The starter kit's `onboard.py` handles that via a UI
"Start" fallback (it boots ~13 nodes; cold start ≈ 2 min).
